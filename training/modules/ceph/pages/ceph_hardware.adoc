Building a Ceph cluster allows you to select various hardware such as the type of CPU, the amount of
RAM, the type and nunber of disk devices as weel as the type and number of network interfaces.

What matters when your are designing a cluster is to identify the use case for a given cluster.
Generally speaking the use cases are defined along the following lines:

* Capacity optimized
* Throughput optimized
* IOPS/Latency optimized

Whatever the use case you are aiming for one thing to always consider is the recovery time
that will be necessary top recover the data in th event of a failure within the cluster.
The common rule to evaluate a good design is that your cluster should be able to recover
from a node failure in a reasonable amount of type, usually 8 hours.

This rule will dictate how much capacity will be hosted in each server based ob the network
configuration you have chosen but also the number of nodes present in your cluster.

Recovery will leverage 20% of the following 2 metrics

* Surviving cluster media bandwidth
* Surviving cluster network bandwidth

To evaluate both metrics, use the following two formulas:

* `{bandwidth_per_disk} * {devices_per_node} * {surviving_nodes} * 20%`
* `{cluster_bandwidth_per_node} * {surviving_nodes} * 20%`

The lesser of the two calculation will be your recovery speed limit and guide
you to determine how much storage each node can actually carry.

TIP: If this limitation does not allow you to recover an entire node in 8 hours,
you will have to make a choice and evaluate if the extended recovery time
does not present too much of a risk for the business.

== Capacity optimized

Capacity optimized clusters are usually designed for pure object storage use cases such as
document archive, video or audio storage, backup data while not designed for video
streaming. Such cluster is essentially relying on the sequential read and write capabilities
of spindles.

The nature of the data and the need to preserve it over a long period of time
is a perfect fit for erasure coding that, through the choice of the correct EC profile,
can increase durability although at the expense of performance.

The following elements to consider for such cluster are:

* All servers have OS on flash devices
* 0.5 core per HDD (assuming a 2 GHz CPU)
* 16GB OS + 5GB per OSD
* 3GB and at least 10GB (recommended 100GB) disk space per Monitor
* 3GB per Manager
* 8GB per RADOS Gateway
* 10GbE for 12 OSDs on both public and cluster networks
* Deploy 1 OSD per disk device
* Host bus adapter for device connectivity

IMPORTANT: SMR HDDs devices are not supported by Ceph

== Throughput optimized

Throughput optimized clusters are usually designed for application that leverage significantly
large IO requests size  but require a decent amount of eprformance through the use of spindles.
Such application all require the write performance to be at a correct level for data ingestion
while providing data restitution. Those applications can be video streaming, media an
entertainment applications or big data applications such as the creation of data lakes.
In general, such applications leverage block devices or object storage.

To guarantee the correct level of performance data protection is implemented
through replicated pools while the presence of flash devices guarantees an optimum
level of performance for BlueStore in combination with spindles to provide the correct
storage density needed.

The following elements to consider for such cluster are:

* All servers have OS on flash devices
* CPU (assuming a 2 GHz CPU)
** 1 core per HDD
** 2 cores per non NVMe SSD
* 16GB OS + 5GB per OSD
* 3GB and at least 10GB (recommended 50GB) disk space per Monitor
* 3GB per Manager
* 8GB and at least 20GB disk space (logging) per RADOS Gateway
* 8GB and at least 20GB disk space (logging) per MDS
* 10GbE for 12 OSDs on both public and cluster networks
* Deploy 1 OSD per disk device
* Use flash devices for RocksDB (1% ratio for block only, 4% otherwise)
* Use space available on flash devices for metadata pools
* Host bus adapter for device connectivity

IMPORTANT: SMR HDDs devices are not supported by Ceph

== IOPS optimized

IOPS or latency optimized clusters are designed around the PCI bus and the use of 
NVMe devices in each node. This type of clusters is appropriate for databae applciations,
SQL or NOSQL, as well as private cloud deployment when virtual machine performance
is a requirement.

The NVMe devices, combined with the usage of Ceph, will place a very hight level of
stress on the CPU of each servers.

The following elements to consider for such cluster are:

* All servers have OS on flash devices
* 10 cores per NVMe SSD (assuming a 2 GHz CPU)
* 16GB OS + 8GB per OSD
* 3GB and at least 10GB disk space per Monitor
* 3GB per Manager
* 8GB and at least 20GB disk space (logging) per MDS
* 10GbE for 2 OSDs
* Only use enterprise grade NVMe flash devices
* Deploy 2 OSDs per NVMe flash device
* PCI bus only for device connectivity

TIP: To estimate the number of IOPS that the cluster will be able to deliver, use the following
formula: `{num_sockets} * {num_cores} * {GHz} * 1500 = RBD_4K_random_iops`
