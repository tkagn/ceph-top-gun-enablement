== Goals

* Deploy RGW in HA mode
* Work with Placement Targets and Storage Classes
* Use Life Cycle policies to transition object to other tiers
* Work with bucket policies
* Configure basic STS authentication
* Secure the RGW endpoint with SSL
* Audit all S3 operations in RGW
* Configure a Multisite Replicated 

== Deploy RGW services

* Create a realm called `single` , add a zonegroup called `singlezg` , and a master zone called `singlezone`
* Deploy two RGW services, using the above mentioned realm and zone, on port 8080
* Create a test user called `user1`, and test rgw setup by creating a bucket * called `bucket1` and object with S3 client

== Deploy a secured(SSL) Ingress service to provide HA

* Deploy an ingress service using ip `192.168.56.100` that will loadbalance client requests between both of the deployed RGW services
* Configure SSL, the SSL termination must be done at the Ingress/HAproxy level
** You can use certificates available on /root/certificates of the admin nodes,
or create your own custom certicates, the SAN of the provided certs covers `s3.example.com` and `s3zone1.example.com`

== Add a new placement target to zonegroup `singlezg`

* Create dedicated EC pools for the placement target
** Create a new EC pool called `singlezone.rgw.ssd.buckets.data` pg count 32, with 2+1 EC and host failure domain
*** Enable Bluestore compression: aggressive, snappy
** Create a new replicated pool `singlezone.rgw.ssd.buckets.index` pg count: 8, replica 3 and host failure domain
** Create a new replicated pool `singlezone.rgw.ssd.buckets.non-ec` pg count: 8, replica 3 and host failure domain
* Create a Placement target called rgwec
** Users should be able to store data on the new placement target using a reference tag when they create their vuckets

== Configure a LifeCycle policy to transition objects to a COLD Storage Class

* Create a new RGW data pool used for storing Cold Data
** Create a new EC pool called `singlezone.rgw.cold.buckets.data` pg count 16, with 2+1 EC and host failure domain
* Create a new Storage Class called `COLD` in the DEFAULT Placement Group
** Create a new bucket called `data1`
** Configure a Life Cycle policy that will transition objects to the `COLD` Storage class after 10 days
** Apply the LCP to the `data1` bucket
** Upload some objects and test the LCP is working(Remember rgw_lc_debug_interval to speed things up)

== Create a Bucket Life Cycle policy

* Create a new user called `user2`, create a bucket called `policy` with the following layout:
** Policy
*** Policy/reads
*** Policy/write
* Create a Bucket policy that will give `user1` the following access to bucket `policy`
** Policy/ <-  list objects(not read/GET)
** Policy/reads <- read(GET) 
** Policy/write <-  write(PUT/DELETE) 

== Configure Local Database STS(using AssumeRole)

* We need to allow `user1` and `user2` to assume a IAM role called `role1` that will give them full access to a bucket called `admin`
** Create a new RGW `admin` user
*** With the `admin` user create and `admin` bucket and add 1 object
** Enable the STS endpoint in the RGW services
** Create a new IAM role called `admin` 
** Create a Role Policy Document that will allow `user1` and `user2` to assume `role1`
** Create a new role policy that allows `user1` and `user2` full access to bucket `admin`
** Using an AWS client assume the IAM `admin` role using STS
** USe the temporal token created to access the `admin` bucket

== Audit all S3 operations
* Configure the opslog, so all S3 operations get stored in * /var/log/ceph/`FSID`/opslog.log

== Configure a new realm that has multisite replication

* New Realm/Zonegroup/Zone
** On site1 the one we already have configured, we need to create:
*** A realm called: `multi`
*** A zonegroup called: `singlezg1`
*** A zone called: `singlezone1`
*** New RGW instances and pools for this Realm

* We need a second Ceph Cluster configured
** The second site ceph deployment needs:
*** A realm called: `multi`
*** A zonegroup called: `singlezg2`
*** A zone called: `singlezone2`
*** RGW instances and pools for this Realm

* Test that the Multisite replication is working between sites.

== Enable per-bucket replication

* Disable Full zonegroup replication
* Create a new bucket called `sync1`
* Configure symmetrical replication for bucket `sync1`
* Create a new bucket called `sync2`
* Configure uni-directional replication from zone `singlezone1` to `singlezone2`
* Test bucket granular replication
